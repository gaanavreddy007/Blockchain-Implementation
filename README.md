# **Blockchain Implementation in Python**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a simple blockchain implementation in Python that demonstrates core blockchain concepts, including proof-of-work mining, transaction validation, and block integrity. It is designed for educational purposes and blockchain enthusiasts who want to understand how blockchain technology works.  

## **Features**  
✅ **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Implements mining with adjustable difficulty  
✅ **Secure Transactions**: Cryptographic hashing ensures block integrity  
✅ **Genesis Block**: Automatically generates the first block  
✅ **Mining Rewards**: Incentivizes miners with block rewards  
✅ **Tamper Detection**: Ensures the blockchain remains immutable  

## **Installation**  
### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  

### **Clone the Repository**  
git clone https://github.com/gaanavreddy007/Blockchain-Implementation.git
cd Blockchain-Implementation

### **Run the Blockchain Demonstration**  
python blockchain.py

## **How It Works**  
1. **Genesis Block Creation**: The first block is automatically created.  
2. **Adding Transactions**: Transactions are added before mining a block.  
3. **Mining Blocks**: Blocks are mined using proof-of-work.  
4. **Validation**: The blockchain is checked for integrity.  

## **Example Output**  
🔗 Creating Blockchain...
Genesis block created and mined!

📝 Adding transactions...
Transaction added: Alice -> Bob: $1000.0

⛏️ Mining first block...
Block mined! Nonce: 23984
Block 1 has been added to the chain!

🔍 Validating blockchain...
✅ Blockchain is valid!
